# Words
*These words are fun and fairly uncommon but useful once known.*

### Making and Coding

**Bodge** - a British word meaning "to patch together temporarily". Something bodged is put together clumsily and inelegantly, but fully operable given upkeep and maintenance. Be proud of these but do not allow them to extend beyond small scale endeavors. [竊余(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIFE7h3m40U)

**Clbuttic Mistake** - A mistake resulting from well intentioned code having widespread unintended side-effects. "Clbuttic" itself comes from one such mistake in which a program designed to replace offensive words with less offensive variants was a bit too enthusiastic. Make backups and consider edge cases to avoid these. [竊余(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6NJkWbM1xk)

**Onosecond** - The second after you have made a terrible mistake. In this moment you say "oh, no" as you realize how badly you have messed up and that you cannot do anything to revert it. These are powerful moments for learning. [竊余(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6NJkWbM1xk)

#### Useful Terms
**Diegetic Audio** - Sound that originates from the environment shown in a film. Diegetic audio segments are often used to break up music videos to prevent the audio files from being taken from them and used in place of the original songs. [竊余(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G025oxyWv0E)
