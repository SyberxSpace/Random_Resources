# Language Facts
*These facts relate to some element of writing, language, communication, or similar.*

#### Written/Typed Language

* The octothorpe is called the “pound sign” because the symbol originates from the abbreviation for weight *libra pondo*, originally written as ℔. When written quickly in cursive this symbol morphed into the “hash” we love today. The British symbol £ also originates from this phrase, but is instead based on the L at the beginning.

* Rather than writing ?! or !? you can merge the symbols and write ‽ instead. This symbol is known as the interrobang and denotes a question expressing surprise or incredulity. [↗](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/interrobang)

* English, when written, typed, and printed, often contains “ligatures”: glyphs that take the place of multiple letters to approximate how type is written. Common examples include ﬀ, ﬂ, and ﬃ, but less common characters like ﬆ and ﬅ also exist. Feel free to use these to get a few extra letters into your tweets.

* The dot on the lowercase i is called a tittle. The same is true for the j. [↗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tittle)

#### Spoken Language

* Ye is pronounced "The". Y was used by typesetters to represent the þ symbol, called the “Thorn” (“þorn”) when printing on german made printing presses. This sound later was represented as “th” instead. [↗](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVWvkZbhgAc)

* When shown a picture of a spiky shape and a rounded shape and asked to name one “Kiki” and the other “Bouba” the vast majority of people, regardless of language, will call the former Kiki and the latter Bouba. [↗](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TDIAObsqcs)

* Read and Lead rhyme two different ways. They also don’t rhyme two different ways. English is weird sometimes.
