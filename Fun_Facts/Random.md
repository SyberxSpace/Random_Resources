# Uncommon Knowledge
*Random but interesting details about the world around us.*

#### Perception

* Mirrors do not flip left-right. They flip in-out. We often think about text as being “flipped” when we see it in a mirror, but that is because we flip the text toward the mirror to look at it. If you write the letter R on a transparent film and look at it in the mirror it will look the same as it does outside. When we look at a book in a mirror we turn the book over to face the mirror, hence the Я we see in the mirror. [↗](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t4dOPxKgrY)

* The colors pink and purple are not associated with specific electromagnetic frequencies (colors of light). Instead they only occur when our eyes perceive both red (long) and blue (short) wavelengths of light simultaneously. This is why purple and pink are not in the rainbow.

* The color brown does not exist. It is simply orange with context. When our eyes see orange light that is less bright than its surroundings it is perceived brown, while orange light brighter than that threshold is orange. This means that you cannot have a brown lightbulb. [↗](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4aWZRtTwU)

#### Science

* There is no simple answer to the question “Which planet is closest to Earth?” as planets constantly move in their orbits. The answer to the question “Which planet comes closest to Earth in its orbit?” is Venus, but the answer to “Which planet is on average closest to Earth?” is Mercury. This is actually true for all planets in the solar system, as Mercury’s orbit makes it the universal mostest closest planet. [↗](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SumDHcnCRuU)

* Figs you eat are female. Male figs, called caprifigs, are not good to eat. Female figs are pollinated by wasps that begin their lives in male figs. Males of the brood mate with females and then free them from the fig they are born in, at which point the female wasps leave to find new male figs to lay their own eggs in. If they find female figs instead of male figs the pollen they carry from their home fig is used and the fig proceeds to digest them. Yes. This means all figs you eat have digested wasps.
