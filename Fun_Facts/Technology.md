# Interesting Technology
*Details about technology that are useful or interesting.*

* **Deadlatches** - The small tab in the latch of a door should *NOT* click into place when you press on a door firmly. This is not the door “fully closing” but instead a security feature called a deadlatch failing and being bypassed. That pin, when properly used, prevents the latch of the door from being pressed in. This allows doors to shut without their handles being turned. [↗](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ6jm7_CmXk)

* **Hashes, Salts, and Peppers** - These three elements systematically increase password security. A hash is a complex function that takes in a string of data and outputs a seemingly random string based on it. Given the output data it is extremely difficult to reverse engineer the original string but easy to verify a new input matches the original data. To make a hash even more difficult to crack a “salt” can be applied by adding random changes or additions to the password before hashing it. This prevents the hashes of common passwords (known as rainbow tables) from being easily used. The final (and least used) element that can be added is a “pepper”. A pepper is a random change (like a letter added to the end) where the change is not stored. This means that to submit the password all possible peppers must be tried. This only takes moments for a real user but exponentially increases work for a hacker. [↗](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--tnZMuoK3E)

* **USA Voltages** - The USA electrical system is not strictly 120v. Instead the system has 3 AC phases 120° out of sync. This allows for 120v to be obtained via 1 phase and the center ground, 208v using two of the phases, and 240v using all 3 phases. This allows more power to flow through smaller wires while also providing a range of useful voltages. You can see these 3 phases (and a shared neutral, often placed below) hanging from most utility poles. [↗](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMmUoZh3Hq4)

* **Warning Sounds** - Fire alarms and carbon monoxide alarms generally made distinct sounds, even when in the same unit. Fire alarms sound in three long beeps [BEEP - BEEP - BEEP] while carbon monoxide alarms sound in four short beeps [BLIP-BLIP-BLIP-BLIP].
